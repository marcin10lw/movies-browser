The Movies Browser is a platform that allows users to search and browse movies, popular actors and actresses, as well as their production history. The website was created by a team of three individuals as part of a group project and was completed within three weeks.

The page dedicated to popular movies is a hub of cinematic masterpieces, boasting a collection of 10,000 of the most highly acclaimed productions in the industry. From timeless classics to modern-day blockbusters, the page features a comprehensive array of films across a diverse range of genres.

Each movie is represented by its poster, as well as the genres to which it belongs and its average rating. Users can explore the movies at their leisure, immersing themselves in the worlds that each film has to offer. The page provides an excellent opportunity for users to discover movies they may not have considered before.

When a user clicks on any of the movies featured on the popular movies page, they are taken to a dedicated page for that particular film. Here, users can find more information about the cast and crew who worked on the movie.

The individual movie pages are designed to give users a better understanding of the film they are interested in. The plot summary provides a brief overview of the story, allowing users to decide if the movie is something they would enjoy watching.

In addition to the popular movies page, the website also features a dedicated page for the most popular actors. This page showcases the names of 10,000 of the biggest and most recognizable stars in the film industry.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
